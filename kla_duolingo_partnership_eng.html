    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>1. Proposal Overview</h2>
        <p>Through the partnership between Duolingo and the Korean Language Academy (KLA), we aim to provide a richer Korean language learning experience to global learners. This collaboration seeks to enhance the effectiveness of Korean language learning and to help learners deeply understand the Korean culture and language environment through various educational resources.</p>

        <h2>2. Background of the Proposal</h2>
        <p>Korean has gained worldwide interest due to K-POP, K-dramas, and movies. The number of users learning Korean through Duolingo's platform is steadily increasing, and more in-depth educational programs are needed to meet their growing interest.</p>

        <h2>3. Main Objectives of the Partnership</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expansion and Deepening of Korean Learning:</strong> By adding KLA's curriculum, we provide a wide range of learning content from beginner to advanced levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing Cultural Experiences:</strong> KLA's programs, which convey the context of Korean life and culture, will be integrated into Duolingo to allow learners to experience Korean culture.</li>
            <li><strong>Establishment of a Korean Language Academy:</strong> A language academy will be established in Korea, targeting international university students, providing intensive and systematic Korean language education.</li>
            <li><strong>Connection with Student and Visit Programs:</strong> Duolingo users who reach a certain level of Korean proficiency can be linked to KLA's student programs and short-term visit programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Forms of Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content Provision:</strong> KLA will provide lecture materials and cultural learning content to be included in Duolingo's Korean language course.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing and Promotional Collaboration:</strong> Joint events and promotions using both organizations' networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Establishment of a Korean Language Academy:</strong> Online and offline educational programs will be provided so that learners can study and experience Korean culture directly in Korea.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Expected Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duolingo:</strong> Improve the quality of education and increase user satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>KLA:</strong> Promote KLA's educational programs worldwide, encouraging more learners to visit Korea.</li>
            <li><strong>Learners:</strong> Provide opportunities not only for language learning but also for directly experiencing Korean culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The collaboration between Duolingo and KLA will significantly contribute to providing a better Korean learning experience to global learners. We hope to further discuss the details of this partnership with Duolingo.</p>
